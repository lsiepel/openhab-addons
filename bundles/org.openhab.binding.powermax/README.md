# Powermax Binding

Visonic produces the Powermax alarm panel series (PowerMax, PowerMax+, PowerMaxExpress, PowerMaxPro and PowerMaxComplete) and the Powermaster alarm series (PowerMaster 10 and PowerMaster 30).
This binding lets you control the alarm panel (arm/disarm) and use Visonic sensors (motion, door contact, etc.) within openHAB.

The PowerMax provides support for a serial interface.
This serial interface is not installed by default but can be ordered from any PowerMax vendor (called the Visonic RS-232 Adapter Kit).

If your alarm panel is connected directly to a serial port of your openHAB server (or to a USB port through a serial-to-USB converter), you must set up a serial connection thing type in openHAB.

You don't even need to have your alarm panel connected directly to your openHAB server.
For example, you can connect it to a Raspberry Pi and use the [ser2net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ser2net/) Linux tool to make the serial connection available on the LAN (serial over IP).
In this case, you must set up an IP connection thing type in openHAB.

Here is an example ser2net.conf you can use to share your serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 on IP port 4444:

```text
4444:raw:0:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT
```

Visonic does not provide a specification of the RS-232 protocol; thus, the binding uses the available protocol specification given at the [domoticaforum](https://www.domoticaforum.eu/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=6581).

The binding implementation of this protocol is largely inspired by the [Vera plugin](http://code.mios.com/trac/mios_visonic-powermax).

## Supported Things

This binding supports the following thing types:

| Thing  | Thing Type | Description                                                                       |
|--------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ip     | Bridge     | The IP connection to the alarm system.                                           |
| serial | Bridge     | The serial connection to the alarm system.                                       |
| x10    | Thing      | An X10 device.                                                                     |
| zone   | Thing      | A zone representing a physical device such as a door, window or a motion sensor. |

## Discovery

The alarm system is not discovered automatically.
First, manually create a bridge thing—either of type IP or serial—depending on how your openHAB server is connected to the alarm system.
Then the binding will automatically discover all zones and X10 devices that are set up in your alarm system.

## Binding configuration

There are no global binding configuration settings that need to be set.
All settings are provided through thing configuration parameters.

Notes:

- On Linux, you may get an error stating the serial port cannot be opened when the Powermax binding tries to load.
  You can resolve this by adding the `openhab` user to the `dialout` group, for example: `usermod -a -G dialout openhab`.
- Also on Linux you may have issues with the USB if using two serial USB devices e.g. Powermax and RFXcom.
  See the [general documentation about serial port configuration](/docs/administration/serial.html) for more on symlinking the USB ports.

### Zone

The zone thing requires the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter Label | Parameter ID | Description      | Required |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Zone number     | zoneNumber   | The zone number. | true     |

## Console Commands

The binding provides few specific commands you can use in the console.
Enter the command `openhab:powermax` to get the usage of each available command.

```shell
Usage: openhab:powermax <bridgeUID> info_setup - information on setup
Usage: openhab:powermax <bridgeUID> download_setup - download setup
```

The command `info_setup` displays information about your current panel setup.
The command `download_setup` will trigger a new download of the panel setup.

Example command: `openhab:powermax powermax:serial:home info_setup`.

## Notes and limitations

- For Powerlink mode to work, the enrollment procedure must be followed.
  If you don't enroll Powerlink on the PowerMax, the binding will operate in Standard mode; if enrolled, it will operate in Powerlink mode.
  On newer software versions of the PowerMax, Powerlink enrollment is automatic, and the binding should operate only in Powerlink mode (if enrollment is successful).
- In Powerlink mode, the binding downloads the panel setup at startup.
  When openHAB starts, this download may fail on a Raspberry Pi for unclear reasons (possibly because many services start simultaneously).
  A retry mechanism will attempt up to three times with a delay of one minute between attempts.
  In most cases the download eventually succeeds.
  If it still fails, you can trigger the download later by using the `download_setup` channel or the console command.
- Visonic does not provide a specification of the RS-232 protocol; use this binding at your own risk.
- The binding is not able to arm/disarm a particular partition.
- The compatibility of the binding with the Powermaster alarm panel series is probably only partial.
- In order to be able to bypass zones, you must first enable this feature by updating your panel configuration. Look at your installer's manual.
