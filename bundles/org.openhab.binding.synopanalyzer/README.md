# Synop Analyzer Binding

This binding downloads and interprets SYNOP weather observation messages.

## Binding Configuration

The binding itself has no configuration options; all configuration is done at the thing level.

## Supported Things

There is exactly one supported thing type, which represents a SYNOP message: `synopanalyzer`.

## Discovery

If a system location is set, the nearest available SYNOP station will be automatically discovered for this location.
The search radius expands with each successive scan.

## Thing Configuration

- `stationId` — The WMO station number (see the [station list](https://www.ogimet.com/gsynop_nav.phtml.en)).
- `refreshInterval` — The refresh interval in minutes.

SYNOP messages are typically updated every hour.

## Channels

The weather information that is retrieved is available as these channels:

| Channel Type ID       | Item Type          | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| temperature           | Number:Temperature | Current outdoor temperature                |
| pressure              | Number:Pressure    | Current pressure                           |
| wind-speed            | Number:Speed       | Current wind speed                         |
| wind-speed-beaufort   | Number             | Wind speed according to Beaufort scale     |
| wind-angle            | Number:Angle       | Current wind direction                     |
| wind-direction        | String             | Wind direction                             |
| overcast              | String             | Appreciation of the cloud cover            |
| octa                  | Number             | Part of the sky covered by clouds (in 8th) |
| attenuation-factor*   | Number             | Cloud layer attenuation factor             |
| time-utc              | DateTime           | Observation time of the Synop message      |
| horizontal-visibility | String             | Horizontal visibility range                |

- "Cloud attenuation factor" (Kc) as defined by Kasten and Czeplak (1980).
