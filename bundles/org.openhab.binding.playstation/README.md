# Sony PlayStation Binding

This binding allows you to monitor the on/off status and which application is currently running on your PlayStation 4.
By providing your user credentials you can also change the power state, which application is running, and more.

## Supported Things

This binding should support all PS4 variants.
It can also tell if your PS3 is on, off, or not present.

## Discovery

Discovery should find all your PS4s within a few seconds as long as they are in standby mode and not completely turned off.
To discover your PS3, you need to turn on "Connect PS Vita System Using Network" in
Settings -> System Settings -> Connect PS Vita System Using Network.

## Thing Configuration

| userCredential      |         | Yes      | A key used for authentication, obtained via PS4-waker.                   |
| pairingCode         |         | Yes      | This is shown on the PlayStation 4 during pairing, only needed once.     |
| passCode            |         | (Yes)    | If you use a code to log in to your user on the PS4, set this.           |
| connectionTimeout   |  60     | No       | How long the connection to the PS4 is kept open (in seconds).            |
| autoConnect         |  false  | No       | Whether a connection should be established to the PS4 when it's turned on. |
| artworkSize         |  320    | No       | Width and height of downloaded artwork.                                  |
| outboundIP          |         | No       | Use this if your PS4 is not on the normal openHAB network.               |
| ipPort              |  997    | No       | The port to probe the PS4 on, no need to change normally.                |

If you want to control your PS4, the first thing you need is your user credentials. This is a 64-character hex string that is most easily obtained by using PS4-waker (<https://github.com/dhleong/ps4-waker>).
To run PS4-waker, you will need Node.js installed (for example: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>).
Enter "npx ps4-waker --help" in the command prompt. Agree to install by entering "y".
After that send "npx ps4-waker --check". You will get asked to connect the "PS4 Second screen" Android app to the running clone.
Do this, and then you will need to get the pairing key from your PS4: Settings -> Mobile device pairing settings.
On the PS4 screen you will see your pairing code and in the command prompt you will find the user credentials.

Then you need to pair openHAB with the PS4.
This can be done by saving the thing while the pairing screen is open on the PS4. The code is only needed during pairing.

If you have a passcode when you log in to your PS4, you must specify that as well.

## Caveats and Limitations

I tried my hardest to figure out how to turn on the PS3 through Wake-on-LAN, but it looks like Sony never got it to work properly. The only way I've seen it turn on is via Wi‑Fi, but if you connect your PS3 to your router via Wi‑Fi and enable Wake‑on‑LAN, it can turn itself on randomly.
