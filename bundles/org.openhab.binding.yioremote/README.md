# YIOremote Binding

This binding controls a YIO Remote/Dock setup. YIO Remote/Dock is a smart-home solution that includes an IPâ€‘based remote. More information is available at [yio-remote.com](https://www.yio-remote.com/) or in the [community forum](https://community.yio-remote.com/).

This binding has been designed to complement the YIO WebSocket transport protocol.

Since this binding lets you trigger IR send/receive actions on the YIO Dock, you can use the dock as an IR solution for openHAB and even learn new IR codes from your remotes. In other words, if the IR code is known, openHAB can use the YIO Dock to control that device even if there is no dedicated openHAB binding for it.

# Actions

With the YIO remote action, you can send IR Codes via the YIO Remote Dock.

## Example

```java
rule "yioremote Action Example"
when
  ...
then
    val actions = getActions("yioremote", "yioremote:yioRemoteDock:livingroom")
    if (actions === null)
    {
        ......
    }
    else
    {
        actions.sendIRCode("3;0x20DF40BF;32;0")
    }
end
```

## Full Example
